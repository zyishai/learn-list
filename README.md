## Overview

Maintain list of things that I did in resolution of month and year.

## Technologies

-   **React** <small>(react & react-dom)</small> - Front end UI library. Used to add virtual dom, state binding and component architecture.
-   **Mobx** <small>(mobx, mobx-react, mobx-react-devtools & mobx-utils)</small> - Advanced state management library. Observe changed to variables and update observers accordingly.
-   **Webpack** <small>(webpack, webpack-cli & webpack-dev-server)</small> - Bundling tool. Used to grab all assets in a project (html, js, css, images etc), transporm them (transpilation, minification, uglification etc) and bundle them for easy deployment.
-   **Tape** <small>(tape, tape-async, babel-tape-runner)</small> - Test runner for testing app's model. Also, support async-await syntax via `tape-async` plugin (and has more plugins).
-   **Jest** <small>(jest, jest-babel)</small> - Testing library for React which support UI testing via snapshots.

## Code Styling

## These are the tools that I'm using in order to enforce coding style in my project:

-   **.editorconfig** - Used to set default editor configurations (encoding, indentation etc).
-   **Eslint** <small>(eslint)</small> - Linter, used to alert when coding style is not correct or there are syntax errors.
-   **Prettier** <small>(prettier)</small> - Used to enforce styling rules, also auto correct coding style on save.

## Style

-   **Rebass** - Tiny react components, using styled-components.
